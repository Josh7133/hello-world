Getting started to learn how to code. :)

Hi my name is Josh, and I would like to lean to how to code. I started with the basics and learned HTML. I would like to be able to build off of what I know,which is little,and learn how to become an adept programmer. I have a long way to go however I am excited to start my journey.
